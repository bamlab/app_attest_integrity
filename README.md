  <p>Flutter plugin to assess app integrity with server-side verification on iOS and Android with a single, simple API.</br>
  </br>Securely sign your client data to prove that it came from a legitimate, untampered app instance, downloaded from the Play Store / App Store on a real, not rooted nor jailbroken device.</br>
  </br> Made by <a href="https://apps.theodo.com">Theodo Apps</a> ‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüíõ.</p>
</p>

Follows the official guidelines from Apple and Google:

- **iOS:** [App Attest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/establishing-your-app-s-integrity)
- **Android:** [Google Play Integrity API (Standard)](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/standard)

<br/>

## Features

- üå± **Unified API** across iOS and Android (when possible)
- ‚òÅ **server-side verification** following the official guidelines from Apple and Google
- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Warmup** the Play Integrity server for faster first calls on Android (optional)
- üîê **App Attest** key creation & attestation (iOS)
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Sign & verify client data** with platform-backed keys
- üß± **Replay-attack resistant** (challenge/nonce-based)

<br/>

## Platform setup

### iOS

- Requires **iOS 14+** on a **real device** (simulator not supported).
- Ensure your bundle identifier and entitlements are correctly configured according to Apple‚Äôs documentation.

### Android

- Requires **API 21+** and a device with Google Play services.
- Link to a **Google Cloud project** and note the **Cloud Project Number** (used by the plugin).

<br/>

## Dart API

```dart
import 'package:app_attest_integrity/app_attest_integrity.dart';
import 'package:app_attest_integrity/src/model/generate_attestation_response.dart';

final integrity = AppAttestIntegrity();

// ANDROID ONLY: warm up the Integrity API backend
Future<void> androidPrepareIntegrityServer(int cloudProjectNumber);

// IOS ONLY: create an App Attest key pair & get an attestation for your server
// Return a keyID and an attestation to be sent to your server.
Future<GenerateAttestationResponse?> iOSgenerateAttestation(String challenge);

// Sign client data (JSON string). iOS requires a keyID. Android needs the
// cloud project number only if you didn't call androidPrepareIntegrityServer before.
Future<String> verify({
  required String clientData,
  String? iOSkeyID,
  int? androidCloudProjectNumber,
});
```

## Usage

> See also the [example app](https://github.com/bamlab/app_attest_integrity/tree/main/example/lib/main.dart).

### iOS: first-time attestation

> **Do this once per user/device:** <br/>
> "Don't reuse a key among multiple users on a device because this weakens security protections. In particular, it becomes hard to detect an attack that uses a single compromised device to serve multiple remote users running a compromised version of your app. [...] Try to limit new key generation to only [app reinstallation, device migration, restoration of a device from a backup], or to the addition of new users. Keeping the key count low on a device helps when trying to detect certain kinds of fraud." <br/> _From [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/establishing-your-app-s-integrity)._

```dart
final serverChallenge = await fetchServerChallenge(); // ‚â•16 bytes of entropy

final attestation = await integrity.iOSgenerateAttestation(serverChallenge);


await sendAttestationToServer(
    attestation: attestation.attestation,
    keyId: attestation.keyID,
);

// Persist keyID locally for future verify() calls
await saveKeyId(attestation.keyID);

```

> Your server must verify the attestation with Apple‚Äôs App Attest service and **store** the `publicKey` contained in the attestation with this user/device. See the [server documentation here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating-apps-that-connect-to-your-server#Verify-the-attestation).

<br/>

### Android: warm up (recommended)

```dart
// Call this before needing to use `verify` to speed it up.
await AppAttestIntegrity().androidPrepareIntegrityServer(YOUR_CLOUD_PROJECT_NUMBER);
```

<br/>

### Sign client data (both platforms)

```dart
final clientData = {
  "nonce": challengeFromServer,
  "new_score": 138,
  "uid": currentUserId,
};

final signature = await AppAttestIntegrity().verify(
  clientData: json.encode(clientData),
  iOSkeyID: await loadKeyId(), // REQUIRED on iOS, ignored on Android
  // androidCloudProjectNumber: YOUR_CLOUD_PROJECT_NUMBER, // not needed if warmed up
);

// Send both the clientData and the signature to your server:
await postVerificationPayloadToServer(
  clientData: clientData,
  signature: signature,
);
```

<br/>

## Best practices

- Follow the provided [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/establishing-your-app-s-integrity) and [Google](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/standard) documentation.
- **Always** include a server-generated **challenge** in `clientData`.
- Enforce a **strict TTL** for nonces (e.g., 2‚Äì5 minutes).
- Tie nonces to **user/session** and invalidate after use.
- Log and **rate-limit** repeated failures.
- Be prepared for **cold starts** (Android) ‚Üí call `androidPrepareIntegrityServer` early.
- On iOS, ensure `iOSgenerateAttestation()` succeeded **once** per user/device and **persist** the `keyID`.

<br/>

## Error handling

Common cases you should surface or retry:

- **Unsupported device** ‚Üí surface a clear error and bypass sensitive flows.
- **No iOS keyID provided** on `verify()` ‚Üí instruct to run attestation first, properly save the `keyID`.
- **Integrity token provider missing** when not providing `androidCloudProjectNumber` ‚Üí call `androidPrepareIntegrityServer()` or pass the number directly.
- **Network/Timeout** ‚Üí retry with backoff; do not retry attestation infinitely.
- **Clock issues** ‚Üí rely on server time for TTLs and issuance time validation.

## Security

If you discover a security issue related to this plugin's logic, **do not** open a public issue. Please contact the maintainers privately at [flutter@bam.tech](mailto:flutter@bam.tech) and allow time for a fix before disclosure.
